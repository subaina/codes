1 .1.What do you observe in the list of suggestion? Are there any patterns?
No their is no pattern in search engines.
2.Which search engine's list of suggestion is better and why?
google is better than other 2 engine bcz google is populer and usefull form other engines
3.Do all search engines return the same result?
no. all serach engines are not return the same rezults.they have different search engines
4.Which site is listed in the top 5 results of all 3 search engines?
The top 5 search engine are here their are 2 engines are in top 5 google and bing

1.Google

2.Bing

3.Yahoo

4.Baidu

5.Yandex
7.Do you think that the order of the websites in the search results is important?
yes its important

try to find which mechanism / formula / algorithm(s) are being used to order the results. A search algorithm is a massive collection of other algorithms, each with its own purpose and task.
Context Matters It’s important to understand how algorithms function to apply context to what you’re experiencing/reading. When you hear of an algorithm update, it’s important to know that what is being updated is likely a small piece of a very large puzzle. Knowing this assists in interpreting which aspects of a site or the world are being adjusted in an update and how that adjustment fits into the large objective of the engine.

Entities Are Super Important Further, it’s critical moving forward to understand that entities: Play a massive role in search algorithms today. Have their own algorithms. Will play an ever-increasing role over time. Knowing this will help you understand not just what content is valuable ( how close are those entities you’re writing about ? ) but also which links are likely to be judged more favorably. And that’s just to name a couple of advantages.

Search algorithms work as a large collection of other algorithms and formulas, each with its own purpose and task, to produce results a user will be satisfied with. In fact, there are algorithms in place to monitor just this aspect of the results and make adjustments where ranking pages are deemed not to satisfy user intent based on how users interact with it. Included in this are algorithms designed specifically to understand entities and how entities relate to each other in order to provide relevancy and context to the other algorithms.

How do search engines work ? Search engines work through three primary functions:

Crawling: searches the web with automated programs called crawlers, looking for pages that are new or updated.stores those page addresses (or page URLs) in a big list to look at later. We find pages by many different methods, but the main method is following links from pages that we already know about.
Indexing: visits the pages that it has learned about by crawling, and tries to analyze what each page is about. analyzes the content, images, and video files in the page, trying to understand what the page is about. This information is stored in the index, a huge database that is stored on many computers.
Serving search results: When a user performs a search, tries to determine the highest quality results. The "best" results have many factors, including things such as the user's location, language, device (desktop or phone), and previous queries. For example, searching for "bicycle repair shops" would show different answers to a user in Paris than it would to a user in Hong Kong. doesn't accept payment to rank pages higher, and ranking is done algorithmically.
